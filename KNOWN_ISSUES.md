# Known Issues

Current known issues for the Fallout 2 CE Extended engine with **RPU** and **Et Tu**.
Open issues carry their investigation state (root cause hypotheses, ruled-out work,
next steps) so nobody re-does work already done. Sources: in-game user reports and
debug-log analysis, 2026-08-18/19.

Fixed items are removed from this file once verified and shipped (see git log + AGENTS.md
for the full investigation trail of each).

## Open issues

_None currently open. New reports: capture in this file with root-cause hypotheses and
next steps as they emerge._

## Debugging notes

`Error during execution: VOODOO write_int/byte(0x00499xxx, ...) — NOT SUPPORTED in
CE engine` — gl_classic_wm.int's VOODOO_WriteNop procs attempt direct memory
patching (sfall-era engine addresses). The fork correctly rejects them. The
classicWM art swap now works via fs_copy, so these are benign-but-noisy. Mod-side
issue; engine behavior is correct.

## Debugging notes

- DBGTRACE instrumentation (program create/free/exit traces, UAF detectors, teardown
  markers, `[COMBAT]` lines) is silent unless `[debug] mode=log` is set in the cfg —
  then everything lands in `debug.log` in the game folder.
- `[debug] console_output_path=<file>` captures the in-game console.
